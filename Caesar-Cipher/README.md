This program askes for an interger key to use for the cipher. It also takes an input text (argument) and converts it to a cipher text using the concept of a caesar cipher. 
The caesar cipher takes each character and replaces it with a different character that is a fixed number of places down the alphabet. In other words, if you compare each 
letter in the unciphered text to each of the respective letters in the ciphered text, you will notice that the letters in the cipher text will all be a certain constant 
away from the original letters. 

For example, if you were to input 3 as the input key and "Hello" as the input text, the output text would be "Khoor". 

Of course, improvements can be made by replacing the input text with news letters which come before the letters in the input text. However, this cipher should not be used 
as it is fairly easy for hackers to decrypt such ciphers. Nonetheless, this program demonstrates the concept of ciphers and a specific type of cipher.
