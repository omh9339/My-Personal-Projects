# My-Projects

These are my projects. Don't forget to look at the side files(.txt, .h, etc.) as they will help you understand the main code file more. The following languages were used: C++, C, Python (Jupyter Notebook), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

P.S. These projects were done from my fascination and curiosity with certain topics as well as some world related issues:
   1. Sports knowledge 
   2. How computers use, interpret, and transform colors(RGB values)
   3. How hackers decrypt passwords
