# My-Projects

These are my projects. Don't forget to look at the side files(.txt, .h, etc.) as they will help you understand the main code file more. 

P.S. These projects were done from my fascination and curiosity with certain topics:
   1. Sports knowledge 
   2. How computers use, interpret, and transform colors
   3. How hackers decrypt passwords
