The SuperBowlWinner.txt file contains winners from all of the Superbowls except for Superbowl 54. 

This .txt file was integrated with the main .cpp code file in order to create a program that prompts the user for a football team's name and returns the number of superbowls the team won and the years in which it won. If the team did not win a SuperBowl(in other words, it will not be on the .txt file), then the program will say that team has yet to win the SuperBowl. 

Note: Enter the teams' names exactly how they appear in the .txt file
