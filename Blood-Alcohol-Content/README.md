This program shows a way in which drunk drivers can be analyzed for their estimated blood alcohol content 


The formula used in the program was B = -0.015 * t + ((2.84 * N) / (W * g))

The formula has variables which are defined as:
B = percentage of blood alcohol content
N = number of standard drinks (This variable should be at least 1)
    (NOTE: A standard drink is one 5-ounce glass of wine, one 1.5-ounce shot of distilled liquor, or one 12-ounce beer)
W = weight (in pounds)
g = gender constand (0.68 for men and 0.55 for women)
t = number of hours since the FIRST drink

Here are the possible effects returned by the program based on the BAC estimate. 

              BAC Estimate	                              Possible Effects
Less Than 0.03%	                                Normal behavior, no impairment | 
0.03% or greater, but less than 0.06%	            Mild euphoria and impairment | 
0.06% or greater, but less than 0.10%	          Euphoric, increased impairment | 
0.10% or greater, but less than 0.20%	            Drunk, loss of motor control | 
0.20% or greater, but less than 0.30%	             Confused, possible blackout | 
0.30% or greater, but less than 0.40%	                  Possibly unconscious | 
0.40% or greater	                                  Unconscious, risk of death
