This project was done as a part of the COVID-19 DATA Challenge sponsored by UC San Diego. Working in a team of 6, we made this leaflet map with risk ratings of restaurants 
and bars. Refer to the google colab link at the top to see the map on google colaboratory.

Note: This is only a sample of the main code. We didn't want all of our work being released.
