Chatbots are used everywhere today. One of the many advantages of chatbots is service. Instead of waiting in a call line, which could sometimes take up to a few hours 
depending on the issue, chatbots can direct users to the root of their solution or to a specific customer service location. Because many companies utilize the power of AI 
to meet their needs or make futuristic products for clients, chatbots can serve as an application of automated technology.
